# Covid19-IBecon-Project
Idea by a 14 Years Old Boy living in HKSAR, China. 

Project NOT STARTED as of now. Advice from experts extreamly valued. 

Both Android and IOS phones are able to act as I-Beacon Transmitters. Every single citizen will install this app onto their phones. A database will be created on each phone locally for cost contacts with the fields : 'I-Beacon ID, Date, Time, Signal Strength, Signal Duration'. If someone is to be infected and confirmed, the I-Beacon ID will be recorded onto the server. All apps from the phone will check with the server and compare those lists of IDs with the close contact I-Beacon IDs. If a person is deemed a close contact, the date and time of contact will be uploaded to the server database as close contact, ring 1. All phones will also compare their list of close contacts with the 'close contact database' on the server to find close contact 1, 2 , 3, and so on in no time to prevent further spread. This app will NOT record the location of citizens and thus there will be no worry of security issues. For citizens without phones, cheap I-Beacon transmitters can be purchased at the cost of less than 1HKD (or 1/7.8 USD) for the poor/ peeople who make up excuses if this is to be enforced.
